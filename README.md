# Vehicle Information Next.js Application

## Overview

This application is a Next.js-based project designed to let users filter and view vehicle makes and models by selecting a vehicle type and model year. The application uses the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) API to fetch and display data.

## Features

- **Filter Page**: Users can select a vehicle make and model year from dropdowns. Once selections are made, a "Next" button enables navigation to the results page.
- **Result Page**: Displays the list of vehicle models for the selected make and year, fetched from the NHTSA API.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Uses Next.js's server component features for efficient data fetching and page rendering.
- **Suspense Loading State**: Implements Reactâ€™s `Suspense` to show loading feedback while fetching data.

## Project Architecture

- **Pages**: The project uses Next.js's file-based routing system. The main pages are:
  - `FilterPage`: The home page with dropdowns for vehicle make and year selection.
  - `ResultPage`: Displays results for the selected vehicle make and year.
- **API**: Uses the NHTSA API for real-time data fetching.
- **Environment Variables**: The application uses environment variables for API URLs, stored in `.env.local`.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for responsive and modern UI design.
